## Wiring America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Electricity Grid Expansion 
### Job Market Paper

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Transitioning to an electricity grid that fully realizes the benefits from renewable energy will require substantial investment in transmission lines. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale grid expansion projects aimed at enhancing the integration of wind energy in the US. I focus on the rollout of a large scale transmission expansion project in Texas for my empirical analysis. Short-run analysis shows that transmission expansion led to a 2-2.5% decline in markups during the peak demand hours and a 7% decline during the off peak hours. Transmission expansion also prevented about \$44 million worth of annual damages (2011 \$) from the marginal generators. In the long-run, transmission expansion on an average led to 62 - 72 MW higher wind capacity, 30 - 40 more turbines, and 32 MW bigger wind projects in counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure. Given a growing need for investment in grid expansion in the US, this paper provides evidence of significant market impacts in the short- and the long-run in response to grid expansion.
