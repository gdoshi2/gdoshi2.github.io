In my Job Market Paper, I study the short- and long-run impacts of electricity grid expansion. Below is the abstract!

**Wiring America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Electricity Grid Expansion**
----

The US aims to achieve a carbon-free power sector by 2035. Transitioning to an electricity grid that fully realizes the benefits from renewable energy will require substantial investment in transmission lines. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale grid expansion projects aimed at enhancing the integration of wind energy in the US. I focus on the rollout of a large scale transmission expansion project, CREZ in Texas for my empirical analysis. Short-run analysis shows that transmission expansion led to a 2-2.5 percent decline in markups during the peak demand hours and a 7 percent decline during the off-peak hours. In the long-run, CREZ expansion on an average led to about 62 - 72 MW higher wind capacity, 30-40 more turbines, and about 32 MW bigger wind projects in counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure. Given a growing need for investment in grid expansion in the US, this paper provides evidence of significant market impacts in the short- and the long-run in response to grid expansion projects.
