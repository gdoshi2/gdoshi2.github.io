Wiring America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Electricity Grid Expansion (**JMP**)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Transitioning to an electricity grid that fully realizes the benefits from renewable energy will require substantial investment in transmission lines. This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of large scale grid expansion projects aimed at enhancing the integration of wind energy in the US. I focus on the rollout of a large scale transmission expansion project in Texas for my empirical analysis. Short-run analysis shows that transmission expansion led to a 2-2.5% decline in markups during the peak demand hours and a 7% decline during the off peak hours. Transmission expansion also prevented about \$51 million worth of annual damages (2020 \$) from marginal emissions in the short-run.  In the long-run, transmission expansion on an average led to 62 - 72 MW higher wind capacity, 30 - 40 more turbines, and 32 MW bigger wind projects in counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure. Given a growing need for investment in grid expansion in the US, this paper provides evidence of significant market impacts in the short- and the long-run in response to grid expansion.

Electricity Market Structure and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Renewable Energy <br/> (_with [Sarah Johnston](https://www.sarahbjohnston.com/)_)
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper examines the effects of electricity market deregulation and long term contracting on technology adoption in the solar and wind industries in the US. Using data on all the solar and wind projects from 2001-2019, we estimate discrete choice models of technology adoption as a function of market structure and other characteristics. Results indicate that long term power purchase aggreements play a major role in technology adoption in the wind industry. The decision of solar projects to adopt tracking technology is a function of project size with smaller projects in deregulated markets less likely to adopt tracking. We do not find significant evidence that competition promotes technology adoption, but it may hinder adoption if it reduces the use of long-term contracts.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Texas electricity market saw a recent integration of electricity transmission as a part of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ). Exploiting the commissioning date of CREZ based transmission integration as an exogenous shock, we analyze the effect of transmission expansion on market clearing prices of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR). Reduced form estimates suggest that excess transmission led to a lowering of CRR prices for contracts at all Times of Use. We find strong evidence of spatial, distributional, and firm specific heterogeneity. The paper shows that transmission expansion enhanced efficiency of the CRR market in terms of a spatial convergence in prices and a decrease in aggregate auction expenditure of approximately $260 million over a period of 4.5 years post CREZ.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
This chapter explores the reasons behind trade growth in goods and services over the years for some selected countries by using Novyâ€™s measure. We calculate trade costs in terms of tariff equivalents by using the indirect trade cost measure given by Novy. Trade costs and trade growth accounting in both goods and services are shown separately. For trade costs in goods, we look at the case of India and APEC countries, and for trade costs in services we consider the 61 trading partners for which data is available.
