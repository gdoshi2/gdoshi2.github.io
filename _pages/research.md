 Texas electricity market saw a recent integration of electricity transmission as a part of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ). Exploiting the commissioning date of CREZ based transmission integration as an exogenous shock, we analyze the effect of transmission expansion on market clearing prices of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR). Reduced form estimates suggest that excess transmission led to a lowering of CRR prices for contracts at all Times of Use. We find strong evidence of spatial, distributional, and firm specific heterogeneity. The paper shows that transmission expansion enhanced efficiency of the CRR market in terms of a spatial convergence in prices and a decrease in aggregate auction expenditure of approximately $260 million over a period of 4.5 years post CREZ.

This chapter explores the reasons behind trade growth in goods and services over the years for some selected countries by using Novyâ€™s measure. We calculate trade costs in terms of tariff equivalents by using the indirect trade cost measure given by Novy. Trade costs and trade growth accounting in both goods and services are shown separately. For trade costs in goods, we look at the case of India and APEC countries, and for trade costs in services we consider the 61 trading partners for which data is available.
