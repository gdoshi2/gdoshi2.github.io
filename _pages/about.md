Hi! I'm Gaurav Doshi. I'm a PhD student at the Department of [Agricultural & Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My CV is [here](http://gdoshi2.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are in Energy and Environmental Economics. I am interested in exploring the interlink between energy policy, electricity markets, and investment in renewable energy. My current work especifically focuses on the market and non-market impacts of government policies like grid expansion and electricity market deregulation in the US. I use economic theory and state of the art econometric methods to answer questions that have potential implications for climate change.  

In my job market paper, I analyze the short- and long-run effects of electricity grid expansion. For the short-run, I focus on the pricing behavior and emissions from fossil fuel generators. For the long-run, I examine how grid expansion drives investment in wind energy. In my other work, I study how market deregulation and long term contracting affects innovation within the solar and wind industries.

Before moving to the US for my PhD, I completed my undergrad in Economics from the Department of Economic Sciences at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), India in 2017. If you're interested in talking about my work, or yours, please feel free to [connect](mailto:gdoshi2@wisc.edu)!
