Hi! I'm Gaurav Doshi. I'm a PhD student at the Department of [Agricultural & Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Before moving to the US for PhD, I completed my undergrad in Economics from the [Department of Economic Sciences](https://www.iitk.ac.in/eco/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), India in 2017. My CV is [here](http://gdoshi2.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are in Energy and Environmental Economics and Industrial Organization. In my current work, I study the market impacts of electricity grid integration in the US. I analyze the implications of electricity market integration on strategic responses by fossil fuel generators as well as long term effect on electricity generation from renewable sources. I am also interested in studying how energy policy and market deregulation affects innovation within the solar and wind industries. 

If you're interested in talking about my work, or yours, please feel free to [connect](mailto:gdoshi2@wisc.edu)!
