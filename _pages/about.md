Hi! I'm Gaurav Doshi. I'm a PhD student at the Department of [Agricultural & Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Before moving to the US for my PhD, I completed my undergrad in Economics from the [Department of Economic Sciences](https://www.iitk.ac.in/eco/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), India in 2017. My CV is [here](http://gdoshi2.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are in Energy and Environmental Economics and Industrial Organization. In my current work, I study the market impacts of electricity grid integration in the US. I analyze the short-run effect of transmission expansion on electricity pricing behavior of fossil fuel generators as well as long-run effect on electricity generation from renewable sources. I am also interested in studying how energy policy and market deregulation affects innovation within the solar and wind industries. 

If you're interested in talking about my work, or yours, please feel free to [connect](mailto:gdoshi2@wisc.edu)!
